#Feature: Service should provide endpoint to search users
#  Check if service can search users using a text filter
#
#  Scenario: Unauthenticated user cannot search
#    When I use the queryparams:

#    And I GET to '/v1/users'
#    Then I should receive the status code 403
#
#  Scenario: Search with a not existing term should return no users
#    Given I am authenticated
#    When I use the queryparams:
#      | $search | $$$$ |
#    And I GET to '/v1/users'
#    Then I should receive the status code 200
#    And The response data should be an empty list
#
#  Scenario: Search without a term should return all users
#    Given I am authenticated
#    When I GET to '/v1/users'
#    Then I should receive the status code 200
#    And The response data should have 4 items
#
#  Scenario: Search with the term 'user' should return all users
#    Given I am authenticated
#    When I use the queryparams:
#      | $search | user |
#    And I GET to '/v1/users'
#    Then I should receive the status code 200
#    And The response data should have 4 items
#    And The response data name property should all contains 'user'
#
#  Scenario: Search with the term 'user 1' should return only one user
